# CharCNN
A convolutional neural network (CNN) that can detect English characters/letters (written by hand) made using Scikit-learn, Keras, and Tensorflow (displayed with OpenCV2).<br/><br/>
Some large files like the dataset need to be downloaded externally. `requirements.txt` has all the packages needed for this to run, and you must recompile the model first for it to succeed.<br/><br/>
